# StraicoForWP
## Wordpress Plugin to Integrate Straico for Post and Page Creation

This is a little hobby project created and debugged with OpenAI 01-preview model.  It has been an experiment to see how well the 01-preview model could create a Wordpress plugin.
If you want to try it out, just add the .zip file as a plugin in Wordpress.
Your API key can be added in Settings > Straico Settings.

This plugin includes Parsedown.php, from this project: https://github.com/erusev/parsedown -- Parsedown is released under the MIT license (same as this project).
